0. Request an interactive compute node and load the following modules on cedar:
salloc --time=03:00:0 --ntasks=1 --account=def-btaati  --mem=16000M --nodes=1  --gres=gpu:1

module load python/3.6
module load nixpkgs/16.09  gcc/8.3.0 
module load cuda/10.1

source ~/ENV/bin/activate
1. Clone and install mmcv and mmskeleton (and all of their dependencies)
    - I created a virtual environment for all of these
    - The file andrea_req.txt lists the package versions I have installed
    - Be sure to log into wandb so you can look at the training curves

2. If everything is installed, you can trained the position prediction model with this command:
    - python mmskl.py configs/recognition/tri/cluster/configs_for_navid/train_cluster_2_120_pred_15_4_joints.yaml

3. I documented the ambiguous hyperparameters in the above yaml file, and there are a number of things that can be changed. If you want to try a number of configurations, you may need to set up some batch files. An example of how I do this is:
    - mmskeleton/batch/jul22_scale_ablation/pretrain/SAS/v5/temp5/SAS_0_120_pred_15.sh
