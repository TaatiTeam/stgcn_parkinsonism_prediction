# MMSkeleton

## Introduction

MMSkeleton is an open source toolbox for skeleton-based human understanding.
It is a part of the [open-mmlab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) project in the charge of [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).
MMSkeleton is developed on our research project [ST-GCN](https://github.com/yysijie/st-gcn/blob/master/OLD_README.md).

## Features

- **High extensibility**

    MMSkeleton provides a flexible framework for organizing codes and projects systematically, with the ability to extend to various tasks and scale up to complex deep models.

- **Multiple tasks**

    MMSkeleton addresses to multiple tasks in human understanding, including but not limited to:
    - [x] [skeleton-based action recognition (ST-GCN)](./doc/START_RECOGNITION.md)
    - [x] [2D pose estimation](./doc/START_POSE_ESTIMATION.md)
    - [ ] skeleton-based action generation
    - [ ] 3D pose estimation
    - [ ] pose tracking
    - [x] [build custom skeleton-based dataset](./doc/CUSTOM_DATASET.md)
    - [x] [create your own applications](./doc/CREATE_APPLICATION.md)
